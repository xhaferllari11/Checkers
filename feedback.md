## Features 

Congratulations! You met all the minimum requirements for Project One. Also, all of the minimum features are fully functional and your game has all the required states we would expect for it to be played.

Examples of the different game states include:

- Start State
- Win State
- Lose State

## Code Style and Best Practices

Excellent work here, you have no commented-out or "dead code" in your files and you also use separate files inside of appropriate sub-folders for your `HTML` `CSS` and `js` code.

For your JavaScript, all of your `js` functions names clearly express their purpose in the form of a verb and also with your variable names in the form of a noun. You also utilize camel casing with your identifiers and you have no console.logs in your code either. Your indentation is also very well implemented as well.


There were a couple of things I saw that I recommend making a slight adjustment to. For instance, I saw a heavy usage of the standard equality `==` and inequality `!=` operators. Although these do function as expected, the best practice would be to use the strict equality or inequality operators respectively. The reasoning behind this is that you are checking both the value and types in your comparison statements.

Your CSS was solid. You made an awesome use case for CSS variables also. For your HTML, you did great with your overall style/indentation. Be sure to use the new HTML5 semantic elements such as `main`, `section`, `header`, `footer` ... etc. One other thing was with your image elements. I noticed you have a separate class selector for each `img` tag. A better practice would be to use an `id` or `data` selector/attribute instead. 



## Documentation and Deployment

Great job getting your game successfully deployed to GitHub pages. Also, a good job with your project's `README`. One thing I will point out here is that it's usually a better practice to name your project's `README` in all caps. Also, make sure you check your project's description for typos before publishing your final version to your master branch.


## Other Conventions and Best Practices

The usage of "empty" image elements in your HTML as placeholders is a very clever idea. However, one thing to keep in mind, that technically this practice wouldn't pass the official `w3c` `HTML` validation standards. So, perhaps for your next version, you could find a way to dynamically add these using your JavaScript rather than leaving them hard-coded in your `HTML`.

Overall, excellent work here, Alban! If you have any questions regarding this feedback, please feel free to contact me!
